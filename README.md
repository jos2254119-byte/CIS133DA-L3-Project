> NEEDS TO BE EDITED

# Lesson 3 Project
This project will assess your knowledge and skills using the various concepts taught within the lesson. 
1. You will need to create 2 HTML pages that utilize the appropriate semantic elements to achieve the desired goal of the steps. 
2. You will need to style the pages following the directions. 
3. You will need to validate your code to ensure there are no errors or problems.
4. You will need to apply the accessibility best practices you have learned.

## Project Prep
1. If you haven't done so already, clone the repo to your computer within your course folder.
2. Open the repo within VS Code. You can open this `readme.md` file within VS Code to view the project directions there. 
   > *TIP: Right click on the file and choose the `Open Preview` option.*
3. If there are files and folders present other than this `readme.md` file, take some time to familiarize yourself with the files within the repo so you know where they are located. This will help you when asked to use them within the project directions.

> TIP: Before beginning any work on the project, read through all the steps to understand what you will be doing.

   4. Create a link to the `main.css` file. 
      > *TIP: Refer to the CSS Styling Directions below to determine the file path.*
5. Save the file and apply a commit to your file.

   6. Within the footer:
      1. Create an unordered list with the following list item: `Lesson Activities`.
      2. Create a nested unordered list with 6 list items. Each list item should be a hyperlink to the HTML files you created during the practice activities you for the lesson. Do not link to the index.html practice activity file.
      > TIP: You can get the URLs to use for the `href` by opening the practice activity repo on GitHub within your browser, navigating to the HTML file, and then copying the URL from the address bar in your browser. You can then repeat this process for each file.

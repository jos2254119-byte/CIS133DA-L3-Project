# Lesson 3 Project
This project will assess your knowledge and skills using the various concepts taught within the lesson. 
1. You will need to create 2 HTML pages that utilize the appropriate semantic elements to achieve the desired goal of the steps. 
3. You will need to validate your code to ensure there are no errors or problems.

## Project Prep
1. If you haven't done so already, clone the repo to your computer within your course folder.
2. Open the repo within VS Code. You can open this `readme.md` file within VS Code to view the project directions there. 
   > *TIP: Right click on the file and choose the `Open Preview` option.*
3. If there are files and folders present other than this `readme.md` file, take some time to familiarize yourself with the files within the repo so you know where they are located. This will help you when asked to use them within the project directions.

> TIP: Before beginning any work on the project, read through all the steps to understand what you will be doing.


## Project Directions
The following is an example screenshot of what your page should look like at this point, barring any differences in content, colors, fonts, etc.

## Submit the Project
Before you submit your project:
1. Make sure that you have validated your HTML and CSS code. If any errors were found within the validators, be sure to fix those errors before you submit your assignment.
   > TIP: The validator extensions that you installed during the course introduction will provide details within the Problems tab as you code, which you can open from the `View` menu and then selecting the `Problems` option.
2. Save your files and apply any final commits to your work.
3. Push (i.e., sync) the repo on your computer with GitHub to ensure all files are uploaded for your instructor to see.
4. Verify that all files appear on GitHub.
> TIP: You can view any of your repos by going to the GitHub organization for the course - [RSC-CIS233DA-in-v8](https://github.com/rsc-cis233da-in-v8). You can bookmark the page for future reference. 
5. Open the Pull Requests tab within GitHub (or using the GitHub Extension within VS Code).
6. In the comment field, 
   1. Type in your instructor's username with an `@` before. See the course announcements for their username to use. 
   2. Put a note to your instructor that the assignment is ready to grade.
7. Click on the `Comment` button to finalize and submit your assignment for grading.
